#1 super security anti-spam captcha plugin for Wordpress forms.



== Description ==

The Captcha plugin allows you to implement a super security captcha form into web forms. It protects your website from spam by means of math logic, easily understood by human beings. You will not have to spend your precious time on annoying attempts to understand hard-to-read words, combinations of letters or pictures that make your eyes pop up. All you need is to do one of the three basic maths actions - add, subtract and multiply.
This captcha can be used for login, registration, password recovery, comments forms.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `captcha` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin via the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Plugin settings are located in "Captcha".



== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= Why the CAPTCHA is missing in the comments form? =



The Captcha by BestWebSoft plugin displays the CAPTCHA for those comments forms which were written in the same way as comments forms for the standard WordPress themes.



Unfortunately, the plugin is incompatible with comments forms generated by using SAAS (eg: Disqus or JetPack comments forms).



If you don't use SAAS comments forms, please follow the next steps:



1. Using FTP, please go to {wp_root_folder}/wp-content/themes/{your_theme}.

2. Find and open `comments.php` file. It is possible that the file that is used to display the comment form in your theme called differently or comment form output functionality is inserted directly in the other templates themes (eg single.php or page.php). In this case, you need to open the corresponding file.

3. Make sure that the file contains one of the next hooks: `do_action ( 'comment_form_logged_in_after' )`, `do_action ( 'comment_form_after_fields' )` or `do_action ( 'comment_form' )`. If you didn't find one of these hooks, then put the string `<?php do_action( 'comment_form', $post->ID ); ?>` in the comment form.



= I would like to add Captcha to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =



1. Install the Captcha plugin and activate it.

2. (Optional) If you want to use own settings for your custom forms (for example, for your contact and sign up forms), please follow steps below:



a. Open "functions.php" file of your theme in the edit mode;

b. Add the following lines to the end of the file:



`function add_my_forms( $forms ) {

    $forms['form_slug']   = "Form Display Name";

    $forms['form_2_slug'] = "Form 2 Display Name";

    return $forms;

}

add_filter( 'cptch_add_form', 'add_my_forms' );`



Please don't use the next form slugs since they are predefined by plugin settings: general, wp_login, wp_register, wp_lost_password, wp_comments, bws_contact, bws_subscriber, buddypress_register, buddypress_comments, buddypress_group, cf7_contact, woocommerce_login, woocommerce_register, woocommerce_lost_password, woocommerce_checkout.



c. Save file changes;

d. Go to the "Settings" tab on the plugin settings page (Admin Dashboard -> BWS Panel -> Captcha);



If everything is OK, you will see new tabs with labels which you specified in the "cptch_add_form_tab" hook call function.



e. Switch to new tabs and configure form options on them as you need;

f. Click "Save changes";



In case when you don`t want to use own settings for displaying the CAPTCHA in your custom form, the settings from "General Options" tab from the plugin settings page will be used.



3. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add CAPTCHA);

4. Find a place to insert the code for the CAPTCHA output;

5. Insert the following lines:



`<?php echo apply_filters( 'cptch_display', '', 'my_contact_form' ); ?>`



In this example, the second parameter is a slug for your custom form. If you don`t use the custom form settings (see point 2 of this instructions) you can leave it empty:



`<?php echo apply_filters( 'cptch_display', '' ); ?>`



6. After that, you should add the following lines to the function of the entered data checking:



`<?php $error = apply_filters( 'cptch_verify', true );

if ( true === $error ) { /* the CAPTCHA answer is right */

    /* do necessary action */

} else { /* the CAPTCHA answer is wrong or there are some other errors */

    echo $error; /* display the error message or do other necessary actions in case when the CAPTCHA test was failed */

} ?>`



If there is a variable in the check function responsible for the errors output, you can concatenate variable $error to this variable. If the 'cptch_verify' filter hook returns 'true', it means that you have entered the CAPTCHA answer properly. In all other cases, the function will return the string with the error message.





= Can I move the Captcha block in the comment form? =



It depends on the comments form. If the hook call by means of which captcha works (after_comment_field or something like this) is present in the file comments.php, you can change captcha positioning by moving this hook call.



Please find the file 'comments.php' in the theme and change position of the line `do_action( 'comment_form_after_fields' );` or any similar line - place it under the Submit button.

In case there is no such hook in the comments file of your theme, then, unfortunately, this option is not available.
