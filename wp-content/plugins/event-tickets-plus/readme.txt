Event Tickets Plus allows you to sell tickets to your events using WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, or our built in Tribe Commerce tool. Use it on your posts and pages, or add <a href="http://m.tri.be/18vc">The Events Calendar</a> and sell tickets from your events listings.

== Description ==

Event Tickets Plus adds features and functionality onto the core Event Tickets plugin, so you can sell tickets with WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads. You can sell tickets on any existing post type or use <a href="http://m.tri.be/18vc">The Events Calendar</a> for a full events and ticketing solution. Event Tickets Plus gives you the power to keep ticket sales contained entirely within your site. This means no more sending buyers to a third-party portal or requiring an outside solution. Tickets have unique QR codes that make checking in your guests a breeze. Plus, the plugin allows you to take advantage of many of the powerful features already built into your commerce provider (reports, SKU tracking, etc) and apply those specifically to tickets. Whether soliciting free RSVPs to a community gathering or hosting a huge party with multiple price tiers, Event Tickets has got you covered.

= Event Tickets =

* Sell tickets to events directly within the event listings. You can control the branding, look and feel to be consistent with your site's appearance.
* Set different price tiers, limit the number of tickets available, and select timeframes for when tickets are available/unavailable.
* Generate reports (courtesy of your chosen commerce provider) on an event-wide or ticket-specific basis.
* Send printable PDF tickets to purchasers via email.
* Confirm and check in attendees at the door with QR coded tickets.

== Installation ==

1. From the dashboard of your site, navigate to Plugins --> Add New.
2. Select the Upload option and hit "Choose File."
3. When the popup appears select the event-tickets-plus.x.x.zip file from your desktop. (The 'x.x' will change depending on the current version number).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it's finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A message will show confirming activation was successful.
6. For access to new updates, make sure you have added your valid License Key under Events --> Settings --> Licenses.

* Event Tickets 4.6 or above

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Please visit the <a href="http://m.tri.be/18vf">Tickets Plus</a> forum for questions or comments.

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of Event Tickets and Event Tickets Plus. If you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just Event Tickets and Tickets Plus (and any other Events plugins) are running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

If you're an Event Tickets Plus user, you're entitled access to our actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/18vg">premium forums</a> at the theeventscalendar.com website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. We respond to posts within 24-48 hours (during the week).
