<h2>WordCamp Asia 2020 Cancelled &amp; Pop-up Livestream</h2>



<p>There was a ton of excitement around WordCamp Asia, not to mention all the effort from organizers, speakers, sponsors and volunteers. Unfortunately, on February 12th, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordcamp-asia-cancelled-due-to-covid-19/">WordCamp Asia was cancelled</a> due to concern and uncertainty around COVID-19. Since then, the organizing team has worked to <a href="https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org/2020/02/12/cancellation/">refund tickets and to support hotel and air refunds</a>. In addition, a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/pop-up-livestream-on-february-22/">pop-up livestream</a> featuring some WordCamp Asia speakers and a Fireside Chat and Q&amp;A with Matt Mullenweg took place on February 22nd.</p>



<p>For a personal take on the cancellation of WordCamp Asia, read <a href="https://naoko.blog/2020/02/13/wordcamp-asia-2020-recap/">this post from Naoko Takano</a>, the global lead organizer. Many thanks to the volunteers who worked hard to deliver WordCamp Asia. They’ve not only handled logistics associated with cancellation but have also announced that they’ve started <a href="https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org/2020/02/18/wordcamp-asia-2021/">working on WordCamp Asia 2021</a> with some January dates in mind!

<h2>WordPress 5.4 Beta is Now Available</h2>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-1/">WordPress 5.4 Beta 1</a> was released on February 11 and quickly followed by <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-2/">Beta 2</a> on February 18 and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-3/">Beta 3</a> on February 25. These two releases get us closer to our primary goal for 2020: full-site editing with blocks. WordPress 5.4 will merge ten releases of the Gutenberg plugin and is scheduled to be released on March 31, 2020. It will come with many new features, such as two new blocks for social links and buttons, and easier navigation in the block breadcrumbs. There are also a number of accessibility improvements, such as easier multi-block selection and easier tabbing, one of the editor’s biggest accessibility issues. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-4/">5.4 will also include</a> many developer-focused changes, such as improved favicon handling and many new hooks and filters.</p>

<p>This should be a great way to get to hear from some speakers who have yet to share their knowledge on a global stage. WordPress is enriched by a multitude of experiences and perspectives, and I hope you are as excited as I am to hear new voices from a part of the world that is frequently underrepresented in the WordPress open source project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also exciting, <a href="https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org/2020/02/18/wordcamp-asia-2021/">the WordCamp Asia team has announced that they’re aiming for January 2021</a>, so please mark your calendars now! This small but mighty team of trailblazing organizers has shown great resilience over the years they’ve spent, building toward this event. I am personally grateful for the hard work they’ve done and have yet to do, and can’t wait to thank them in Bangkok next year.</p>

<h2><strong>The beginning</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8349" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton.jpg?resize=768%2C767&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Kori Ashton</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 1998, Kori created her very first HTML website. Her dad was creating websites for a living at the time. She needed a website for her band because she wanted to be a rockstar. Under his training, and with a little bit of self-teaching, she learned how to build a website.</p>



<p>She had been aware of WordPress since 2005, and, in 2008 a client specifically hired her as a freelancer to develop a WordPress website. Kori went straight to Google and taught herself how to build a WordPress website over a single weekend. She really enjoyed the experience of working with WordPress.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>My mind was absolutely blown when I saw the drag and drop options inside of menus to create dropdowns and a form builder.&nbsp;</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>



<p>She suggested to her dad that WordPress could be a solution for their customers who wanted to be able to access their own websites. Previously, they had found this was not as easy for clients unless they had specific software and knew how to code. So, Kori and her dad worked to learn WordPress over the next few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then in 2012, Kori and her parents launched their new business, WebTegrity, in San Antonio, Texas, US. It started out small: just Kori and her parents. Soon, they started subcontracting design work and quickly continued to grow their team.</p>



<h2><strong>Going big time</strong></h2>



<p>Even though the business was in a saturated industry in San Antonio &#8212; over 700 freelancers and agencies were providing similar services &#8212;  Kori and her parents were able to sell their company five years later, with a multi-million dollar valuation. There were a few choices they made early on that led to that success.</p>



<h3><strong>1. They picked a niche: WordPress specialists&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>At the time, there were no WordPress-specific agencies in San Antonio. They emphasized the fact that WordPress was the only CMS their company would use. Prospective clients looking for a different type of CMS solution were not the right fit for their business. They also offered on-site, WordPress training and weekend workshops that were open to anyone (including other agencies) as one of their revenue streams. They soon were established as a city-wide WordPress authority.</p>



<h3><strong>2. They cultivated a culture</strong></h3>



<p>Kori wanted a great culture and environment in her company and to make that happen, she needed to hire the right people. She believes you must be careful about who you bring into the culture of your business, but particularly when hiring leaders into that community. You can’t teach passion so you’ve got to find people that are excited about what you do. You also need to look for integrity, creativity, a love for solving problems, and an eagerness to keep getting better.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>You can teach code all day long, but be sure to find people with the right hearts to join your community and then train them up the right way. This way you will grow your culture in a healthy way.</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8350" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?w=711&amp;ssl=1 711w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?resize=287%2C300&amp;ssl=1 287w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Kori and her two sons</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>3. They learned how to build sustainable revenue streams</strong></h3>



<p>Like many other web development agencies, WebTegrity started out with the “one-time fee and you’re done” business model. This business model is known for unpredictable revenue streams. Hearing about recurring revenue business models at WordCamp Austin was a lightbulb moment for Kori. She started drafting a more sustainable business model on the way back home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support packages were key to their new business plan. Clients needed ongoing support. They decided to include at least 12 months of post-launch support into their web development projects. This doubled their revenue in one year and allowed them to even out their revenue streams.</p>



<h3><strong>4. They knew the importance of reputation</strong></h3>



<p>Kori believes that every client, whether they have a $5,000 or a $50,000 budget, should get the same type of boutique-style, white glove, concierge relationship.</p>



<p>Every single project results in the absolute best solution for a client&#8217;s needs. In addition to that, offering training helped boost their reputation. Explaining the lingo of the web development and SEO fields and showing the processes used, added transparency. It helped set and meet expectations and it built trust.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>5. They proactively gave back to the community</strong></h3>



<p>Kori heard Matt Mullenweg speak about <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">Five For The Future</a> at WordCamp US. He encouraged people in the audience who make a living using WordPress, to find ways to give back 5% of their time to building the WordPress software and community. Matt talked about how firms and individuals could give back to the community. He suggested, for instance to:</p>



<ul><li>start a WordPress Meetup group</li><li>present at a Meetup event&nbsp;</li><li>facilitate a Meetup group where maybe you’re just the organizer and you never have to speak because you’re not a fan of speaking</li><li>help organize a WordCamp</li><li>volunteer at a WordCamp</li><li>write a tutorial and tell people how to do WordPress related things&nbsp;</li><li>run a workshop</li><li>make a video</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?fit=632%2C422&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8351" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><figcaption>If you&#8217;re making an income using WordPress, consider giving 5% of your time back to building the software and/or the community.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This gave Kori another light bulb moment. She could make videos to give back. So her way to give back to the WordPress community is her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/webtegrity">YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p>Every Wednesday, she published a video on how to improve your online marketing. This made a huge impact, both inside the WordPress community, but also in her own business.</p>



<h2><strong>Understanding</strong></h2>



<p>So, in summary, how did Kori and her family turn their business into a multi-million dollar buyout in just five years?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was about understanding that you have to build value. About keeping an exit strategy in mind while building your business. For instance when naming your company. Will it stand alone? Could it turn into a brand that you could sell as an independent entity?</p>



<ul><li>Think about revenue streams and watch sales margins.</li><li>Be sure to include healthy margins.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t hire until you have no further option.</li><li>Make sure to structure your offerings in such a way that you’re actually recouping your value.&nbsp;</li><li>Understand entrepreneurship, watch Shark Tank, read more tutorials, watch more videos.</li><li>Get involved in the WordPress community. Get to know its core leaders, the speakers that travel around to all the WordCamps. Start following them on Twitter and try to understand what they’re sharing.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the end, the fact that Kori was so active in the San Antonio community helped enable the sale.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>We just kept hammering on the fact that we were the go-to place here in San Antonio for WordPress. We kept training, we kept doing free opportunities, going out and speaking at different events, and people kept seeing us. We kept showing up, kept giving back and kept establishing ourselves as the authority.</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve arrived at the difficult decision to cancel the inaugural WordCamp Asia event, which was planned to take place in Bangkok on February 21st. The excitement and anticipation around this event have been huge, but there are too many unknowns around the health issues unfolding right now in the region to explicitly encourage a large public gathering bringing together over 1,300 people from around the world.</p>



<p>We’re going to explore if speakers — including myself — can do our sessions with the same content and at the same time that was originally planned, just online instead of in-person so we can achieve our goal of bringing the pan-Asian community closer together without putting anyone&#8217;s health at additional risk.</p>



<p>Regardless, I greatly appreciate the work everyone — from organizers to attendees,&nbsp; speakers to sponsors — put into making this a big success. So many people have come together to create an event to inspire and connect WordPressers, and I am confident that this passion will carry through into the event next year. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the virus so far, and we sincerely hope that everything is resolved quickly so that this precaution looks unnecessary in hindsight.</p>

<p>You can test the WordPress 5.4 beta in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>Try the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (choose the “bleeding edge nightlies” option)</li><li>Or&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.4-beta1.zip">download the beta here&nbsp;(zip)</a>.</li></ul>



<p>WordPress 5.4 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-4/">March 31, 2020</a>, and <strong>we need your help to get there</strong>!</p>



<p>While the <strong>primary goal for 2020 is full-site editing with blocks</strong>, contributors to WordPress are working across every area of the project to ensure the software continues moving forward.</p>



<p>Testing for bugs is an important part of polishing the release during the beta stage and a great way to contribute. Here are some of the big changes and features to pay close attention to while testing.</p>



<h2>Block Editor: features and improvements</h2>



<p>WordPress 5.4 Core will merge ten releases of the Gutenberg plugin. This means there’s a long list of exciting new features. Here are just a few:</p>



<ul><li>Two new blocks: social links and buttons.</li><li>More color options for Button, Cover, Group and Column blocks .</li><li>A <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18041">Welcome Guide modal</a>.</li><li>Tools for adding featured images in the Latest Posts block.</li><li>Easier navigation in the block breadcrumbs.</li></ul>



<p>Some additional changes to make note of:</p>



<ul><li>On mobile, the toolbar stays on top, so you can&#8217;t lose it.</li><li>Easier image sizing in the Gallery block.</li><li>Drag-and-drop images into the featured-image box.</li><li>Several new APIs.</li><li>Friendlier offline error messages on REST API request failures.</li><li>Table block captions.</li><li>You can now color just parts of the text in any RichText block. </li></ul>



<h3>Accessibility improvements</h3>



<ul><li>Easier multi-block selection.&nbsp;</li><li>Support for changing an image&#8217;s title attribute within the Image block.</li><li>Easier tabbing. This had been one of the editor&#8217;s biggest accessibility problems, but now tabbing works with the block’s sidebar.</li><li>Visual switch between Edit and Navigation modes and enable screen reader announcements.</li></ul>



<p>To see all of the features for each release in detail check out the release posts:&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/02/whats-new-in-gutenberg-2-october/">6.6</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16-october/">6.7</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/30/whats-new-in-gutenberg-30-october/">6.8</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/11/13/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-november/">6.9</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/11/27/whats-new-in-gutenberg-27-november/">7.0</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/12/11/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-december/">7.1</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/01/09/whats-new-in-gutenberg-8-january/">7.2</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/01/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-22-january/">7.3</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/05/whats-new-in-gutenberg-5-february/">7.4</a> and 7.5.</p>



<h3>Continuing efforts to improve performance</h3>



<p>The block editor team has achieved a 14% loading time reduction and 51% time-to-type reduction, for a particularly sizable post (~ 36,000 words, ~1,000 blocks) since WordPress 5.3.</p>



<h2>Wait! There&#8217;s more</h2>



<h3>Site Health </h3>



<p>When a project powers 34% of the world&#8217;s websites, there must be a focus on security. This is why contributors continue working so hard on the Site Health Project.</p>



<p>WordPress 5.4 adds a widget on the dashboard that warns administrators of potential issues that could affect their site&#8217;s performance or security. A call-to-action button directs them to the Site Health screen for details and suggested fixes.</p>



<h3>Accessibility improvements</h3>



<p>WordPress strives to improve accessibility with every release, and this release is no different. Version 5.4 will contain the following accessibility enhancements:</p>



<ul><li>Better focus management in Menu, Customizer and Site Health screens, to fix some existing keyboard navigation issues.</li><li>Easier keyboard navigation for better semantics in the Media modal.</li><li>An easier-to-read Privacy Policy Guide.</li></ul>



<h2>For Developers</h2>



<p>5.4 also contains a bunch of developer focused changes.</p>



<h3>Calendar Widget </h3>



<p>The HTML 5.1 specification mandates that a <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code> tag must follow&nbsp;<code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tag (which was not the case in the calendar widget). WordPress 5.4 moves the navigation links to a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> HTML element immediately following the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element in order to produce valid HTML.</p>



<h3>apply_shortcodes() as an alias for do_shortcode()</h3>



<p>Instead of using <code>do_shortcode()</code>, <code>apply_shortcodes()</code> should be utilized instead. While <code>do_shortcode()</code> is not being deprecated, the new function delivers better semantics.</p>



<h3>Better favicon handling</h3>



<p>Now favicon requests can be managed with more flexibility. Administrators can choose a favicon in the Customizer, or upload a <code>/favicon.ico</code> file. The WordPress logo will always load as a fallback.</p>



<h3>Other changes for developers</h3>



<ul><li>Clearer information about errors in <code>wp_login_failed</code>.</li><li>Site ID has been added to the <code>newblog_notify_siteadmin</code> filter for multisite installs.</li><li>Support has been added for the required WordPress and PHP version headers in themes.</li><li>Embed support has been added for TikTok.</li></ul>



<p>Keep your eyes on the&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">Make WordPress Core blog</a>&nbsp;for &nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-4+dev-notes/">5.4-related developer notes</a>&nbsp;in the coming weeks, breaking down these and other changes in greater detail.</p>



<p>So far, contributors have fixed more than <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=5.4&amp;group=component&amp;max=500&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;order=priority">255 tickets in WordPress 5.4</a> with more to come.</p>

<h2>Proposal for an XML Sitemaps Feature Plugin</h2>



<p>In June last year, a team of contributors <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/12/xml-sitemaps-feature-project-proposal/">proposed</a> a feature plugin that would bring standardized XML sitemaps to WordPress Core. Since then, the team has been working to bring this to reality and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/01/27/feature-plugin-xml-sitemaps/">have now published a working plugin</a> to demonstrate this new capability.</p>



<p>The plugin is still in development, but the included features already provide much-needed functionality from which all WordPress sites can benefit. You can install the plugin from your WordPress dashboard or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/core-sitemaps/">download it here</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Meet Robert Cheleuka</strong></h2>



<p>Robert is a self-taught graphic and motion designer turned web designer (and aspiring web developer) from Malawi, Africa. Over the years, he has grown fond of WordPress and has become a loyal user. Still, the journey is rough.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/DSC08818.jpg?resize=632%2C790&#038;ssl=1" alt="Robert Cheleuka" class="wp-image-8303" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Robert Cheleuka</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>Malawi</strong></h3>



<p>Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. A tiny landlocked country with a population of 17 million, it’s largely rural and still considered a developing country. The average entry-level monthly pay for most skilled jobs is about $110. If you&#8217;re employed full-time in the creative industry and if you’re very lucky, you might be able to earn more than that. Employees earning more than $300 a month are rare to non-existent.</p>



<p>Robert has been a freelance graphic designer since about 2011. He started by doing gigs from his dorm in college and from home. Earnings from his freelance jobs increased his interest in entrepreneurship and he started to consider starting his own creative agency.</p>



<h3><strong>How Robert was introduced to WordPress</strong></h3>



<p>Robert first came into contact with WordPress in 2014 when he and a friend started a local tech blog. Before that, all he knew was basic, outdated HTML from high school and some knowledge of Adobe Dreamweaver. They decided to use WordPress, and their new blog looked like it came from the future. They used a theme from the repo and got such positive feedback from the blog they decided to open a content and media publishing agency.</p>



<p>While they got a few web redesign jobs thanks to the exposure the blog brought, they lacked the administrative and business skills needed and ended up going their separate ways. Then in his first real job after college Robert finally took it upon himself to learn the ins and outs of WordPress. He learned how to install WordPress on a server and did some research on customizing themes. </p>



<p>With that knowledge alone he got his first web design clients and started earning nearly as much as he did at his job. Robert soon realized that free WordPress themes would only take him so far, especially with his limited code skills.</p>



<p>Because in Malawi only people who travel abroad have access to credit cards, paying for premium themes was impossible. Like many WordPress designers in developing countries, Robert turned to using pirated themes instead. He knew that was both unsafe and unethical, and decided to learn how to code. Knowing how to build themes from scratch would surely help him rise above the competition. </p>

<h3><strong>The WordPress community from Robert’s perspective</strong></h3>



<p>Robert doesn’t have a lot of interaction with the WordPress community. Although he would search for solutions from blogs about WordPress he had never actually talked to or asked anyone from the community for a solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert believes that this isolation is the result of a glass ceiling &#8212; the WordPress community is partially online and partially in-person, but there isn’t a local group in Malawi. And because Malawi, like many other developing nations, lacks a way to pay online many can’t access premium support, online learning, or most other types of professional development. No matter how welcoming the people of WordPress might be, it can still feel like it mostly belongs to those with enough privilege to conduct business on the internet.</p>



<h3><strong>WordPress &amp; inclusion</strong></h3>



<p>As most freelancers know, it’s really hard to learn while you also still need to earn. Add pitching to clients and shipping graphic design projects… there are only so many hours in a day.</p>



<p>Robert didn’t have a programming background and had always been more of a creative person. In order to grow as a web designer/developer, he needed to learn PHP. Again, without access to a credit card, that was complicated. Also, free coding training wasn’t as widely available as it is now.</p>



<p>Robert wishes that more developers would consider alternative ways for users who cannot pay for courses, themes, or plugins (whether that’s because of available infrastructure or otherwise). He wishes that WordPress tutors and developers would open up ways to accommodate aspiring learners in developing countries who cannot access plugins, courses, and themes, to be able to give back and to participate at another level.</p>



<p>WordPress has allowed him to build an income he would have no other way of earning and it makes a huge difference. He believes sharing stories like his will hopefully make WordPress products and services become more universally available. In addition, he hopes that more aspiring, self-taught developers will find courage in reaching out to connect with others out there.</p>
