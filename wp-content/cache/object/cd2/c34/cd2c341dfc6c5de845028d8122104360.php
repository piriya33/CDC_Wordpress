We call it (creatively) Event Tickets Plus App.</p>
<p>You may be able to guess what this handy app does directly from the name, but here&#8217;s the gist: It scans the QR code from the ticket an attendee receives when registering for an event created with Event Tickets Plus. Scan the code and the attendee is marked as checked in on the event in the WordPress admin. It&#8217;s pretty sweet.</p>

<p>If you do have the app, great! We just so happen to have a little update for you that we think you&#8217;ll love. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;ve added a vibration toggle so that you still get confirmations, even when your phone is in silent mode. In other words, you&#8217;ll now feel when the check-in scan occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; A new torch mode lets you use your phone&#8217;s camera flash as a flash light. This makes it a lot easier to scan tickets when there&#8217;s low light.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;ve added error catching. This will log the bugs you experience on your device and share them with us.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; When users scan a QR code more than once, we&#8217;ll wait until the 5-second timer tied to the QR code is expired. Then the app will try scanning again.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; Some users reported that the home screen API keys would sometimes not save when entered. We&#8217;ve patched that up so your API key is retained when submitted.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;ve updated to latest supported SDK. Now, more phones and operating system versions are better supported. This also adds 64-bit support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fast and Reliable</h3>
<p>Attendees are eager to get in to your event, and you don&#8217;t want to keep them waiting. This is your attendeesâ€™ first experience when they arrive. </p>
<p>You donâ€™t get a second chance to make a first impression. With the Event Tickets Plus app, attendees can whip out their smartphone and present their QR code for a speedy check-in. Old-school printed tickets work the same wayâ€”they show the QR code on their ticket. Your staff scans it, and boom! Check-in are done on the spot and your team is already moving on to the next people in line.</p>
<p>As attendees are checked in, their data is sent back to your WordPress admin. From the admin, you can see real-time attendee reports that show how many people have been checked in compared to the total number of tickets sold.</p>
<p>From the admin, you can still accommodate common scenarios.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I forgot my ticket.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>No sweat. You can look them up in the attendee report and check them in manually!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;This ticket has already been scanned.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If a ticket is scanned after an attendee has already been checked in, the app will return an error message. The most common reason this happens is when someone buys multiple tickets and accidentally prints the same one for everyone in their party. A quick look at the attendee report will show how many tickets were purchased and allow you to manually check-in attendees as needed.</p>

<p>Before we jump into the changelogs, itâ€™s worth mentioning that this round of updates is a <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/release-schedule/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maintenance Release</a>. In other words, this is a smaller update between major updates and is mostly comprised of bug fixes, tweaks and small, but meaningful improvements. It should be safe to update without breaking changes, but we always suggest backing up your site as you would with any WordPress update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Event Tickets has changed the way tickets are displayed on event pages as of <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/event-tickets-4-11-redesigning-tickets-and-attendee-registration/">Event Tickets 4.11</a>.</p>

While all the features will remain in place as you&#8217;ve known it for years, many of the existing view templates will be removed in upcoming releases. If you have customizations or plan on customizing the calendar views, override templates that will be contained in theÂ <samp>/views/blocks</samp> directory.</div>

<h3 id="et">Event Tickets 4.11.1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;re now using the same loading icon for the RSVP block that we&#8217;re using for the tickets block.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; The &#8220;Show attendees list on event page&#8221; settings option now applies to the REST API as well. We added a repository filter <samp>where_meta_related_by_meta()</samp> for getting a post by the meta value of an associated post.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> â€” Some of our code for tickets and RSVPs would run in the background on the front end of post types that did not have tickets or RSVPs enabled. We added aÂ <samp>tribe_tickets_is_enabled_post_context()</samp> function to limit the CSS and JavaScript for tickets and RSVPs to run only on posts with tickets or RSVPs enabled.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We now avoid loading plugin assets on post types that do not having tickets enabled.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; You can hide the remaining number of tickets from displaying in the ticket display settings. We added a filter for <samp>ticket-display-tickets-left-threshold()</samp> to tickets and RSVP blocks and new filters that allow display an &#8220;Unlimited&#8221; label tickets with unlimited quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> -The following views were changed. Please be sure to check whether you have customized any of them before updating.
<ul>
<li><samp>blocks/rsvp</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/rsvp/details/availability</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/rsvp/form/quantity-input</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/rsvp/loader</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/tickets</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/tickets/extra-available-quantity</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/tickets/extra-available</samp></li>

<li><samp>blocks/tickets/item</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/tickets/quantity</samp></li>
<li><samp>blocks/tickets/registration/attendee/submit</samp></li>
<li><samp>tickets/rsvp</samp></li>
<li><samp>tickets/tpp</samp></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; You canÂ <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/156866-Making-Tickets?r=1#global-stock">attach an image</a> to your ticket. It&#8217;d sure make sense to allow you to upload that image in block editor as well so we fixed the header image attachment handling for RSVP blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; In Classic Editor mode, tickets were setting the end sale date to the current time when when no specific date was entered. We fixed that up to ensure that tickets without an end date in the Classic Editor are to end at the start of an event, per the tooltip.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; The &#8220;Show attendees list on event page&#8221; settings option now applies to the REST API as well.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> â€” We found some ticket quantity inputs didn&#8217;t handle filtered <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/156866-Making-Tickets?r=1#basic">maximum allowed ticket purchases</a>. Overriding the maximum purchase quantity (via theÂ <samp>tribe_tickets_get_ticket_max_purchase()</samp> filter) now works in all contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> â€” Changing from one event ticket provider to another (e.g. Easy Digital Downloads to WooCommerce or vice versa) would cause both provider blocks to show on the event page. We are now preventing those duplicate blocks by adding logic to test the current provider against the event&#8217;s default provider.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> â€” When creating or editing RSVPs, the capacity and &#8220;Enable &#8216;Not Going&#8217; responses&#8221; fields were not being saved. To solve this, we&#8217;re checking if a website is running WordPress 5.3+, then adding <samp>show_in_rest()</samp> as an array configuration for capacity and the RSVP &#8220;not going&#8221; fields so that they save properly.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; Changing ticket quantities using the keyboard was incorrectly affecting other tickets in the registration modal and ticket forms. We are preventing missing data when forms are submitted by gracefully handling the &lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; key in the modal form.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; We increased the size of the -/+ buttons that control decreasing and increasing the number of purchased tickets in the ticket form. They were extremely small and enlarging them makes them more obvious and easier to use.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong>&#8211; Users reported that apostrophes were breaking the data entered for ticket types and attendee registration labels in the Classic Editor. To solve this, we are handling special characters for Event Ticket field labels, like single quotes and colons, so they don&#8217;t break the saving.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; On new plugin installs, an event where only RSVPs are enabled was producing a fatal error. To fix that, we&#8217;ve prevented loading RSVPs with the Tickets block <samp>render()</samp><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; font-family: inherit;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; If the threshold for the number of available tickets of a ticket type was set in the event editor and the setting that shows the number of tickets available on the event page was disabled, then the shared capacity checks for ticket quantities were breaking. We corrected the way we handle shared capacity ticket inventories to prevent that.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; When using Event Tickets and Event Tickets Plus without The Events Calendar and switching from the Block Editor to the Classic Editor, tickets would fail to display because of leftover Block Editor comments. This was especially true for those using a page builder that uses <samp>wp: commenting</samp>. We corrected the missing block when switching editors.</li>

<h3 id="etp">Event Tickets Plus 4.11.1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We now avoid loading plugin assets on post types that do not having tickets enabled.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We spent time tidying up attendee registration fields. For example, we tweaked styles around asterisks for required fields to look nicer and clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We are ensuring that the font weight used for text is standardized for attendee fields on single-event and tickets views. Now things look way more consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; WooCommerce tickets no longer show negative quantity available to purchase, such as if a ticket product is already oversold and backorders are not allowed.</li>

Here at The Events Calendar, weâ€™re reflecting back on 10 years of being a part of the WordPress community. Thatâ€™s a lot of years, with lots of great memories and highlights.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past decade, weâ€™ve introduced more than 10 different plugins and add-ons that power WordPress calendars and make it easy for you to manage your events, every step of the way. Weâ€™re proud to play a role in powering our usersâ€™ events and, ultimately, in bringing people together for events around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weâ€™re also proud of what weâ€™ve accomplished in 2019. In this year alone, we&#8217;ve helped our customers with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">25,000 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">support tickets and sent out </span>58<span style="font-weight: 400;"> updates and releases for our plugins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we havenâ€™t just worked hard on the day-to-day maintenance of The Events Calendar. Weâ€™ve also dedicated lots of time and energy this year to releasing </span><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/promoter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brand-new product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and completing the first-ever makeover of The Events Calendarâ€”and thatâ€™s just the tip of the iceberg. Hereâ€™s a look back at some of our biggest projects and accomplishments in 2019:</span></p>
<h2><b>We announced the first-ever redesign of The Events Calendar.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest news of 2019: We announced </span><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/first-look-the-events-calendar-redesign/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first major redesign of The Events Calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This sleek new look officially drops in 2020 (commence the countdown!), but some users have joined our beta launch so they can be the first to test drive the new calendar views.</span><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/first-look-the-events-calendar-redesign/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1889372 size-large" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-665x326.png" alt="New mobile views for Month view and List view." width="665" height="326" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-665x326.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-140x69.png 140w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-300x147.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-768x377.png 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-430x211.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-645x316.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-1068x524.png 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-460x226.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-600x294.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/10/views-redesign-mobile-views-500x245.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The makeover includes a new, elevated aesthetic thatâ€™s design-forward, but still flexible enough to blend in with any website. Plus, we made improvements to mobile views, added a new style for featured events, and addressed a number of known user pain points. Keep your eyes peeled in January for news about the official launch. In the meantime, </span><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/behind-the-scenes-building-the-events-calendars-new-look/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can read up on what went into creating the new look behind the scenes.</span></a></p>
<h2><b>We introduced Promoter to make email marketing for events easier than ever.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exporting attendee lists from WordPress and managing them through a separate email application used to be cumbersome and time-consuming. No more!Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, we were excited to launch </span><b><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/promoter/">Promoter</a>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an add-on that works with The Events Calendar and Event Tickets (or Event Tickets Plus) to manage all of your contacts from within your WordPress dashboard with no extra steps.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/promoter/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1723435 size-large" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-665x333.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="333" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-665x333.jpg 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-140x70.jpg 140w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-300x150.jpg 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-768x384.jpg 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-430x215.jpg 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-645x323.jpg 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-460x230.jpg 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-600x300.jpg 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post-500x250.jpg 500w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/02/blog-post.jpg 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promoter has quickly become a beloved member of The Events Calendar family by helping users streamline their email process and schedule messages in a snap with shortcuts.</span></p>
<h2><b>Split payments changed the game for community calendars.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall, we rolled out </span><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/split-payments-a-game-changer-for-ticket-sales/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">split payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Community Tickets users. This feature makes it easy for calendar owners to earn revenue on tickets that are sold by event organizers, and payments are split right at the time of purchase: Calendar owners receive a fee or portion of each ticket sale, and the rest of the ticket earnings will go directly to the event organizer.Â </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1853370 size-large" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-665x333.png" alt="" width="665" height="333" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-665x333.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-140x70.png 140w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-300x150.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-768x384.png 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-430x215.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-645x323.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-1068x534.png 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-460x230.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-600x300.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments-500x250.png 500w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/08/split-payments.png 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means you (the calendar owner) get your cut and pay out event organizers in one fell swoop: No need to divvy up the earnings after the sales period ends. Less busy work + more $ in your pocket? Sounds like a win to us!</span></p>
<h2><b>A new attendee registration modal for Event Tickets Plus brought major upgrades to ticket sales.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2018, we laid the groundwork for improvements to the attendee registration experience in Event Tickets Plus. The goal: Make it easier for you to collect attendee registration information.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in 2019, we took things a step further by releasing a brand-new </span><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/ticket-registration-just-got-a-whole-lot-better/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attendee registration modal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that pops up when a user selects tickets to purchase.</span><img class="alignnone wp-image-1942846 size-large" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-665x333.png" alt="" width="665" height="333" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-665x333.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-140x70.png 140w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-300x150.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-768x384.png 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-430x215.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-645x323.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-1068x534.png 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-460x230.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-600x300.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration-500x250.png 500w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/Ticket-Registration.png 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a big deal for two reasons: It keeps attendees on the same webpage and eliminates lag time moving between screens. It also adds flexibility for users to update their purchase right within the modal. They can add and remove tickets and update ticket details without ever leaving the pop-up modal. Users can even save the tickets in their cart and go back to shopping without losing any registration details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sweeten the deal, we also updated the checkout design and incorporated intelligent checkout features that prompt users to update ticket details before purchasing. The result is a serious upgrade to the user experience for your attendees. Happy attendees = happy calendar owners = happy us. (We just like to see everyone happy.)</span></p>
<p>Thanks for coming along for the ride this year, and we can&#8217;t wait for all that 2020 brings!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; Update the WooCommerce minimum version as versions prior to prior to 3.7 are now incompatible.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; We found some very slow performance pages. We found that our order status was looking at ALL incomplete orders and ALL of their order items any time a ticket was fetched. You&#8217;ll now find a cleaner way we query pending orders for tickets. We added caching to prevent repeated queries, and optimized meta calls for order information.</li>

<p>You can see that playfulness in the way colors are used throughout the calendar. Gold is tough for design, but this calendar nails it by using it as an accent for actionable items. Notice how gold is used sparingly and only when something needs attention, like links, buttons and navigation. We&#8217;d be <em>feline</em> if we said this wasn&#8217;t an excellent example a clean, well-designed calendar.</p>

<h3>Less is more</h3>
<p>Oh, and there&#8217;s something else worth noting. The Golden Oldies Cat Rescue calendar does exactly what it needs to do â€” nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Sure, The Events Calendar has a full suite of add-ons that offer premium features to the calendar. And sure, we&#8217;d love for you to purchase <em>all of them</em>. But what this calendar does well is pair itself with the right features for what it needs to do. There&#8217;s no need for visitors to submit events to the calendar. Tickets are irrelevant. The calendar employs a combination of <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar/">The Events Calendar</a>, <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/">Events Calendar Pro</a> and <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-filterbar/">Filter Bar</a> to create an effective and pleasant user experience. They can create recurring events, offer different calendar views, and let visitors discover events. It&#8217;s the <em>purr-fect</em> blend of features and functionality. (Sorry, can&#8217;t help myself.)</p>

<p>We&#8217;re at the <em>tail</em> end (ah, again!) of this post but the big takeaway is exercising restraint when it comes to a calendar. It&#8217;s tempting to go all out and make the biggest, beefiest calendar that does <strong>all the things</strong>. But <em>paws-ing</em> for a moment to focus on what your visitors need from your calendar and clawing at the small details is what makes it feel like a natural part of your website. That&#8217;s the cat&#8217;s meow.</p>
<h3>Plugins in use</h3>
<p>The Golden Oldies Cat Rescue site uses the following plugins for its calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar/"><strong>The Events Calendar</strong></a> &#8211; This is our free plugin that&#8217;s used as foundation for the entire calendar.</li>
<li><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar-pro/"><strong>Events Calendar Pro</strong></a> &#8211; This paid add-on unlocks a ton of premium features in The Events Calendar, from <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/714401-Events-Calendar-Widgets">handy widgets</a> to slick calendar views, but this site is primarily using it for the <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/443518-Recurring-EventsEvent-Series-in-Events-Calendar-PRO">recurring events</a> feature.</li>
<li><a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-filterbar/"><strong>Filter Bar</strong></a> &#8211; This paid add-on displays a set of options above the calendar that let visitors filter events by a number of attributes, including cost, time of day, distance, categories and tags, <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/166778-Configuring-Filter-Bar">among others</a>. We generally recommend it for calendars that are packed with events but you can see how Golden Oldies Cat Rescue uses only the filters it needs for a better user experience.</li>

<h3 id="et">Event Tickets 4.11.0.1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; Users reported high CPU usage causing sites to not respond. We now avoid running extra queries when registering assets.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; Event Tickets would only update properly if Event Tickets Plus was updated first. That was backwards. We protected <samp>Tribe__Tickets__Tickets::get_tickets()</samp> to avoid errors with it not being public before upgrading Event Tickets Plus. Updates run properly again.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; Our admin notice describing the <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/event-tickets-4-11-redesigning-tickets-and-attendee-registration/">Attendee Registration feature</a> was creating performance issues. To clean that up, we are preventing Composer Autoloader from taking too much time loading files and have stopped autoloading a class unnecessarily on each page load.</li>

They provide the support that keeps your events afloat (translation: that sweet, sweet cash).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But getting event sponsorships isnâ€™t always easy. If you want to attract sponsors for your next event, you need to do your homework and start perfecting the art of the ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you do it? Weâ€™ll help you get started with these tips on how to make your request stand out so you can get event sponsors in a competitive market.</span></p>
<h2><b>Develop pitch-perfect pricing tiers.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsorships are usually tiered, meaning organizations can choose from varying levels of support for your event. For example, a Platinum sponsorship might cost $5,000 and come with perks like the sponsorâ€™s logo featured throughout your event dÃ©cor. A Bronze sponsorship might cost $500 and come with a small mention in your event program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your research to see what other events in your industry are charging for sponsorship tiers. This insight will help you determine how high you should reach with your own sponsorships. Your tiers should be priced appropriately and competitively for your industry.</span></p>
<h2><b>Create an easy-to-read sponsor deck.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone sent you an off-the-cuff email asking for money, youâ€™d probably hit â€œdeleteâ€ and move on with your day. So imagine yourself as a corporate employee who receives tons of sponsorship requestsâ€”you donâ€™t want to approach them too casually or make your request sound like a slimy money grab. Show that youâ€™re a pro and that your event is worth sponsoring by creating a sponsor </span><a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/deck-marketing-64930.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A deck includes key details about your event and helps prospective sponsors decide if they want to get on board. At a minimum, your deck should highlight:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Audience demographics at your event.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is this an audience your prospective sponsor wants to reach?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Sponsorship incentives. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will companies gain by supporting your event?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A pricing breakdown. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sponsor tiers are available, and what does each tier cost?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you donâ€™t have graphic design chops, not to worry. You can easily create a good-looking deck yourself by using </span><a href="https://www.canva.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or buying an affordable template from a site like </span><a href="https://creativemarket.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing a little bit of money in your deck is always a good idea. By creating a clean, professional sponsor deck, corporations will feel more comfortable supporting your event.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ask the right person.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where youâ€™ll need to do some detective work. Itâ€™s not always easy to find the right person to contact about event sponsorships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start, consider the nature of your organization. Are you a non-profit or a for-profit business? This is an important distinction: Your event objectives can help point you in the direction of the right contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, letâ€™s say you work at the local United Way and youâ€™re organizing a fundraiser. Youâ€™re hoping to attract a sponsorship from Big Corporation. Who do you contact? Your best bet is likely someone who works in the development or community outreach department. These employees are often responsible for working with local nonprofits and handling philanthropic efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, letâ€™s say you run a marketing agency, and youâ€™re hosting a conference on digital advertising. Youâ€™re hoping to attract a sponsorship from the same Big Corporation as the United Way. But since youâ€™re a for-profit company, you donâ€™t want to contact the people who handle philanthropic efforts. Instead, look for a contact in the marketing or brand department. These employees are often the gatekeepers who decide when to partner with businesses in the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, these are just general tips. The right contact will vary widely from company to company. When in doubt, LinkedIn is your friendâ€”search for employees using specific title or department keywords to find a starting point.</span></p>
<h2><b>Make it as easy as possible to support your event.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be clear, concise, and straightforward when you reach out to sponsors. And resist the urge to send a mass email! Tailor each message to the person youâ€™re contactingâ€”nobody likes to feel like an anonymous name on BCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write a paragraph explaining who you are, what your event entails, and why you think the company would be a great partner for your event. Donâ€™t forget to attach your sponsor deck and gently mention deadlines or time constraints on your request. A simple, polite note like, â€œIâ€™m aiming to confirm sponsors by [DATE]â€ will suffice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make it as easy as possible for sponsors to get on board, create a </span><a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where sponsors can easily respond with a yes or no.</span></p>
<h2><b>Follow up (but not in an annoying way).</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people in charge of corporate sponsorships are constantly bombarded with emails and requests. Yours might get lost in the shuffle, so plan to send one or two follow-ups if you donâ€™t hear back within a week or so.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always be courteous and respectful in your follow-ups. If the answer to your request is â€œno,â€ donâ€™t take it personally. There are lots of factors that go into deciding which events to sponsor, from budget constraints to considerations about whether certain events align with a corporationâ€™s goals. Maybe your event wasnâ€™t a fit this time, but you can always try again with a request for your next event.</span></p>

To replace the old in-page method of collecting attendees&#8217; registration information, we introduced a new page where attendees could add ticket details before adding them to their cart. We even hinted at more improvements to come in that release.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re back with another overhaul to the event registration process that makes it even easier (and more enjoyable) for your attendees to purchase tickets.</p>
<p>What changed? Let&#8217;s get into the details.</p>
<h2>A new registration modal</h2>
<p>When we introduced the attendee registration page, it was a temporary feature on the way to building an even better experience. Now, we&#8217;ve taken that page, redesigned it, and turned it into a modal that pops up when a user selects tickets to purchase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1876028" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01.png" alt="" width="1474" height="1102" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01.png 1474w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-114x85.png 114w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-300x224.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-768x574.png 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-665x497.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-520x390.png 520w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-260x195.png 260w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-430x321.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-645x482.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-1068x798.png 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-460x344.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-600x449.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-01-500x374.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1474px) 100vw, 1474px" /></p>
<p>Why is this a big deal? For two reasons.</p>
<p>First, we&#8217;ve eliminated the need for a new page load for users to add attendee information to tickets while registering. That might not sound like a big deal, but keeping users in the current page cuts a step out of the process and speeds things up. No more lag between screens!</p>
<p>Second, users can now make updates to their purchase right there in the modal. They can add and remove tickets without having to close out of the modal and make changes in the page. Again, this cuts a step out of the flow and reduces the amount of clutter for users during registration. This puts the focus on tickets and ticket registration instead of the event content, which might distract some folks from completing a purchase.</p>
<p>Another nice touch we&#8217;ve added: There&#8217;s a new link to save the attendee information and view the cart next to the checkout button. This provides a serious improvement to the user experience, allowing customers to review the purchase and then keep shopping without losing any of their registration details.</p>
<h2>Intelligent checkout</h2>
<p>What happens if a user decides to add or remove tickets after they&#8217;re in the cart? That&#8217;s a sticky scenario: Which ticket was removed? What are the attendee details for tickets that have been added? This could easily wind up causing headaches for both you and attendees.</p>
<p>Event Tickets Plus now recognizes when tickets have been edited in the cart and prompts the user to update attendee information before checking out.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1876029" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02.png" alt="" width="1474" height="987" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02.png 1474w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-127x85.png 127w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-300x201.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-768x514.png 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-665x445.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-480x320.png 480w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-240x160.png 240w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-430x288.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-645x432.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-1068x715.png 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-460x308.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-600x402.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-02-500x335.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1474px) 100vw, 1474px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right! No more missing attendee information or lost details. This means your reports and data are more complete and accurate than ever. Plus, checking in for an event will be even easier thanks to this change.</p>
<p>Another bonus: Ticket cost totals are displayed on this screen, and users can continue to make changes to tickets right there. This is a huge improvement to the user experience and makes the registration process even tighter.</p>
<h2>A sparkling new design</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve updated the interface for tickets in Event Tickets and Event Tickets Plus. It was time for a makeover.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve updated everything, from the ticket block on an event page:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1876030" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03.png" alt="" width="766" height="661" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03.png 766w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-99x85.png 99w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-300x259.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-665x574.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-430x371.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-645x557.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-460x397.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-600x518.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-03-500x431.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></p>
<p>&#8230;to the way forms are styled:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1876031" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04.png" alt="" width="1474" height="899" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04.png 1474w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-140x85.png 140w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-300x183.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-768x468.png 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-665x406.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-430x262.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-645x393.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-1068x651.png 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-460x281.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-600x366.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/09/ar-04-500x305.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1474px) 100vw, 1474px" /></p>
<p>&#8230;and of course lots of little tweaks and improvements in between. We took great care to make a beautiful and consistent interface that will look great on your site.</p>
<h2>Not one, but two ways to register!</h2>
<p>We know that different sites provide different user experiences and that this new registration modal may not cut it for everyone. That&#8217;s why we decided to make <strong>bothÂ  of the registration methods available</strong>. Yep! That means you get to decide whether you prefer users to register events via:</p>
<ul>
<li>the new registration modal, or</li>
<li>the separate landing page between the event and checkout.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options are available in the Tickets settings:</p>
<div id="attachment_1936228" style="width: 1224px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1936228" class="wp-image-1936228 size-full" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings.png" alt="Event Tickets Plus display display settings." width="1214" height="758" srcset="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings.png 1214w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-136x85.png 136w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-300x187.png 300w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-768x480.png 768w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-665x415.png 665w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-524x328.png 524w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-430x268.png 430w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-645x403.png 645w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-1068x667.png 1068w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-460x287.png 460w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-600x375.png 600w, https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2019/12/attendee-registration-settings-500x312.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1214px) 100vw, 1214px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1936228" class="wp-caption-text">Check the box to enable the new registration model, or un-check it to keep the separate registration page.</p></div>
<hr />
<p>We hope you love the new changes as much as we do. Naturally, you&#8217;ll want to use extra caution when installing the new plugin versions to your site. These new features required lots of changes to the code in our templates, so those of you who have added customizations in past releases will want to pay close attention to be sure your custom touches aren&#8217;t lost in the mix. In other words: <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/options-to-create-a-wordpress-backup-database/">backup, backup, backup!</a> It&#8217;s also worth checking out the full changelog in <a href="event-tickets-4-11-redesigning-tickets-and-attendee-registration">the release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re here for you if you have any questions, and we can help you over at our <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com">Help Desk</a>. In the meantime, enjoy the new updates!</p>

We think you&#8217;re gonna absolutely love it because the new process means your attendee data is more detailed and accurate while providing a better user experience on the front end.</p>
<p>We have just a small but powerful addition to The Events Calendar&#8217;s <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/event-aggregator/">Event Aggregator</a>. Users now have a choice to add their Eventbrite events via URL refined by date, or to add all of their events. You&#8217;ll also find some Month view performance improvements.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive into the high-level changes.</p>
<h4>Three choices for collecting attendee information</h4>
<p>Event Tickets Plus has included a feature that allows you to collect additional information from attendees for some time now. For example, if you want to get the t-shirt size for an attendee, you can create a field for it and the attendee fills it out when registering for the event.</p>
<p>This new release gives you more flexibility for how and when to display those fields. In fact, there are three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>A modal that appears before proceeding to the cart and checkout</li>
<li>A page that the user is directed to after viewing the cart but before submitting payment.</li>

<p>We think this gives you a maximum level of control for you to tailor the user experience that best fits your website.</p>
<h4>A fresh new design for tickets</h4>
<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that we&#8217;ve enhanced the way that tickets look on the front end. Even more awesome is that this new design is consistent in both the Classic and Block modes so you have a better visual when creating tickets in the WordPress editor.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/release-schedule/">Feature Release</a> which means it includes major updates. New features mean new code, and while we expect smooth sailing, there could be breaking changes. This is especially important for those of you whoâ€™ve added snippets, plugin extensions, template overrides or modified the core templates to the plugins. We always recommend using a <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/239548-Creating-and-using-a-WordPress-staging-site">staging site</a> to test these kinds of changes before updating on a live site.</p>

While all the features will remain in place as you&#8217;ve known it for years, many of the existing view templates will be removed in upcoming releases. If you have customizations or plan on customizing the calendar views, override templates that will be contained in theÂ <samp>/views/blocks</samp> directory.</div>

<h3 id="et">Event Tickets 4.11</h3>
<p>The bottom line: You&#8217;ll notice that the design of the tickets form has been refreshed and looks better than ever. In addition, the form will look consistent whether you&#8217;re using <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/705692-An-Introduction-to-Tickets-Blocks">Block</a> or <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/156866-Making-Tickets">Classic</a> mode. Heck yeah!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; Tickets made with either the Block or Classic editor now look identical in front-end views.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We added the ability to utilize the block ticket template outside of Gutenberg views.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; The front-end tickets block got a design update and we implemented a copy of tribe-common-styles.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; Currency formatting is so different from one part of the world to the next, so we&#8217;ve added currency formatting by commerce type.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; There&#8217;s a new setting that enables a modal when collecting attendee registration information. Enabling this option triggers a pop-up that allows users to enter their registration information without going to a new page. To make that happen, we added a new tribe-dialog object which implements <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mt-a11y-dialog">mt-a11y-dialog</a> as <samp>tribe-dialog</samp> or <samp>tribe(&#8216;dialog.view&#8217;)</samp> as an extension of <samp>Tribe_Template</samp>.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; New dialogs can be created with a simple call to <samp>tribe( &#8216;dialog.view&#8217; )-&gt;render_dialog( $args )</samp> in PHP.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; The tribe-dialog object sets up all the necessary JavaScript and HTML via passed parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;ve added templates for a basic dialog, modal, confirmation dialog, and alerts â€” all of which can be overridden and customized like other plugin templates.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; Weâ€™ve added some functions that make it easier to create common dialog types: <samp>render_modal()</samp>, <samp>render_confirm()</samp> and <samp>render_alert()</samp>. This will streamline common dialog types in the Dialog View class.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;re now passing a missing &#8220;provider&#8221; argument from <samp>views/registration/content.php</samp> to <samp>views/registration/button-cart.php</samp>.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> &#8211; Updated the .pot file. This file is needed for people <a href="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/794084-Translating-The-Events-Calendar">translating our plugins</a>. It was outdated when shipping Tribe Common 4.10</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We cleaned up the way we add options to the ticket settings tab in PHP to make it more readable and maintainable.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; There&#8217;s now a way to track the installed version history of the plugins. We added <samp>$version_history_slug</samp> and <samp>$latest_version_slug</samp> properties to <samp>Tribe__Tickets_Plus__Main</samp> to make that happen and we&#8217;re checking the versions against the installed version of tribe-common.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We bumped the minimum required WordPress version 4.9.</li>
<li><strong>Tribe Common Hooks</strong> â€“ <a href="https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/tribe.common4.10.0/">https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/tribe.common4.10.0/</a></li>
<li><strong>Plugin Hooks</strong> â€“ <a href="https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/event.tickets4.11.0">https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/event.tickets4.11.0</a></li>
<li><strong>Language</strong> &#8211; <kbd>3 new strings added, 5 updated, 0 fuzzied, and 0 obsoleted</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Language in Tribe Common</strong> &#8211; <kbd>8 new strings added, 0 updated, 0 fuzzied, and 0 obsoleted</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of changes! It tweaks to many of our template files, so please (please, please!) <strong>check if your theme has modified any of the following templates.</strong> If so, you&#8217;ll want to update those templates so they are consistent with the latest versions.</p>

<h3 id="etp">Event Tickets Plus 4.11</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We started utilizing the new <samp>tribe-dialog</samp> for the &#8220;Get Tickets&#8221; buttons in WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; An option was added to enable the new attendee registration modal. The option is enabled by default, but only _for new installations_ of the plugin. The updated plugin will respect the existing settings of current installations.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; The plugin now detects whether the users makes change to the attendee registration information entered for tickets that have been added to the WooCommerce cart. If a change is made (say updating the number of tickets in the cart), then the user will be redirected to a new page where the registration information can be edited prior to purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;re using the updated block ticket template for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads ticket views.</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;ve deprecated templates for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads ticket views. Again, check for customizations in your theme to make sure you are not using any of these deprecated templates.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;ve changed the way we add options to the Ticket Settings tab.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; Like Event Tickets, there&#8217;s now a way to track the installed version history of the plugins. We added <samp>$version_history_slug</samp> and <samp>$latest_version_slug</samp> properties to <samp>Tribe__Tickets_Plus__Main</samp> to make that happen.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We added a couple of helpful links to the WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads checkout pages that allow users to go back to edit their registration information.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We bumped the minimum required WordPress version 4.9.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin Hooks</strong> â€“ <a href="https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/event.tickets.plus4.11.0">https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/event.tickets.plus4.11.0</a></li>

<h3 id="tec">The Events Calendar 4.9.13</h3>
<p>This update is mostly for our subscribers importing events from Eventbrite using Event Aggregator, and to improve the Month view as part of our <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/views-beta/">Views redesign</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; Users now have a choice to add their Eventbrite events via URL refined by date, or to add all of their events.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;re working on page performance as part of our new Views redesign. We added the <samp>Tribe__Cache::warmup_post_caches</samp> method to warmup the post caches for a set of posts when fetching data for Month view.</li>
<li><strong>Tweak</strong>&#8211; Add the <samp>tribe_cache_warmup_post_cache_limit</samp> filter to allow filtering the LIMIT of those warmup fetches</li>
<li><strong>Tribe Common Hooks</strong> â€“ <a href="https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/tribe.common4.10.2/">https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/since/tribe.common4.10.2/</a></li>
<li><strong>Language in Tribe Common</strong>&#8211; <kbd>0 new strings added, 0 updated, 1 fuzzied, and 0 obsoleted</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Language</strong> &#8211; <kbd>29 new strings added, 201 updated, 0 fuzzied, and 0 obsoleted</kbd></li>
